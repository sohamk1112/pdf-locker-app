# pdf-locker-app
 The PDF Locker App is a simple Python application built using Tkinter and PyPDF2 that allows users to encrypt PDF files with a password. Users can select a source PDF file, enter a password, and protect the PDF file. The encrypted PDF file is saved with "_locked" appended to the filename. This project provides a basic user interface for securing PDF files with passwords.
